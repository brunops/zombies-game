## Credits
Although I chose to arrange the code in a completely different way, all these tutorials helped along the way:
* [How to make a simple HTML5 Canvas game](http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/)
* [Making Sprite-based Games with Canvas](http://jlongster.com/Making-Sprite-based-Games-with-Canvas)
* [Optimizing your JavaScript game for Firefox OS](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/optimizing-your-javascript-game-for-firefox-os/)

And the sprites were shamelessly stolen from:
* [Spriters Resource](http://www.spriters-resource.com/)
